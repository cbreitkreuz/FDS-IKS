# FDS-IKS

These MATLAB scripts implement the state reduction approach and finite difference sensitivity-iterative Kalman smoother for the cubed sphere (192x32) configuration of the MITgcm.

Written by C.Breitkreuz.

The code is used in the manuscript "An efficient Kalman smoother method and state reduction approach for (paleo-)ocean state estimation" by Charlotte Breitkreuz , Andr√© Paul, Stefan Mulitza, and Michael Schulz, MARUM - Center for Marine Environmental Sciences and Faculty of Geosciences, University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany.

The main script is Main_FDS_IKS.m.
